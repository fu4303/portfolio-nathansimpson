# nathansimpson.design

Welcome to the GitHub repo of my personal space!

I use it to experiment with new tools and techniques, and express who I am as a practicioner.

The website is based on Gatsby - a React static-site-generation tool, and a library of design system components which also exist in this repo.

## Get Started

To run the website...

1. Ensure you have node and yarn installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository
3. `cd nathansimpsondesign && yarn && yarn dev`
4. Visit the website at `http://localhost:8000`

## Running on other devices

In order to test the website in development on other devices, you need to run the following script, which will tell Gatsby to accept outside traffic.

```bash
gatsby serve --host 192.168.1.4 --port 8000
```

Replace the ip address with the one that matches the Mac on the current network. You will then be able to test this website from any other device, such as an iPhone or iPad by visiting the following address:

`http://192.168.1.4:8000`
